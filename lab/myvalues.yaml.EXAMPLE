# DIRECTORIES
#############
# Linux host:
# Make sure the user with userId, userGroup below has write access. A
# directory will be created by Kubernetes if it does not exist (BUT with the
# user root, hence you will have permission issues e.g. when trying to create
# files within Jupyter)

# Windows host:
# No need to worry about permissions
# BUT: a path C:\GitHub\datalab' must be entered as '/mnt/c/GitHub/datalab'

# Sourcecode directory on your HOST machine
# Will by default be mounted as /home/jovyan/work
sourcecodeDirectory: ''
# Data directory on your HOST machine
# Will by default be mounted as /home/jovyan/data
dataDirectory: ''


# NAMING OF KUBERNETES RESOURCES
################################
# These two keys can have arbitrary values. Choose the same namespace
# for a specific project, but different jupyterReleaseName if you have
# several Jupyter notebooks running in parallel for a specific project

# lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an
# alphanumeric character

# Kubernetes namespace = project name
namespace: myproject
# Helm release name for Jupyter 
jupyterReleaseName: jupyter


# LINUX PERMISSIONS
###################
# Windows host: just leave the defaults
# The Linux user id ("uid") for the main Jupyter user "Jovyan" to use inside
# Jupyter. Best to set it to your host user id (get it on the host by typing
# "id").
# userId: 0 (root) is impossible due to Jupyter's startup script
userId: 1000
# The Linux main user group id ("gid") to use within the Jupyter container Set
# it to your own host Linux gid (command: id, entry for gid).
# If you start a controlboard, the userGroup 65534 (nogroup) will be forced,
# to ensure that the controlboard works as designed
userGroup: 1000
