{{/*- Check if there is a secret already deployed (e.g. user used helm install --wait) */}}
{{- $secret := (lookup "v1" "Secret" .Release.Namespace (include "common.names.fullname" .)) }}
{{- if eq .Release.Namespace "default" }}

!! BE AWARE THAT IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO INSTALL THIS CHART INTO THE DEFAULT NAMESPACE !!

To remove the Helm chart again immediately:

    helm uninstall {{ .Release.Name }}

You might have to delete additional Kubernetes secrets, PVCs and other ressources MANUALLY. Especially PVCs might prevent you to redeploy the Helm chart later. Check the remaining ressources with

    kubectl get secrets -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l 'app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}'
    kubectl get pvc -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l 'app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}'

Then delete all of them with

    kubectl delete secrets -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l 'app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}'
    kubectl delete pvc -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l 'app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}'


{{ end }}

Jupyterlab
==========
{{- if $secret }}
Use the following URL to access your Jupyter notebook:

  Jupyterlab: http://localhost/{{ .Release.Namespace }}/{{ .Release.Name }}?token={{ index $secret.data "jupyterToken" | b64dec }}

{{- else}}

Kubernetes secret for Jupyter token has not been fully deployed yet. To get
the correct URL for your Jupyter notebook, simply re-try the exact same
command you just used, e.g. "helm install" or "helm upgrade", in a few
seconds

{{- end}}

{{- if ne .Release.Namespace "default" }}

CLEANUP
=======
If you want to completely clean up your Kubernetes resources, do the following:
1) Delete the helm chart (this will leave secrets and PVCs intact):

    helm uninstall -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ .Release.Name }}

2) Delete the entire namespace. This will also delete any other helm
   releases such as PostgreSQL, INCLUDING Kubernetes secrets and your database data (stored in PVCs):

    kubectl delete namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}

{{ end }}
