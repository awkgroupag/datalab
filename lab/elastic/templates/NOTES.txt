You can reach the Kibana dashboard using the following URL. It might take a while until Kibana is ready: if you receive a "Service Unavailable" or "404 page not found", just try again a bit later.

    http://localhost{{ .Values.elasticsearch.kibana.configuration.server.basePath }}

From a Jupyter notebook, you can reach the elasticsearch API under

    http://{{ .Release.Name }}-elasticsearch:{{ .Values.elasticsearch.service.ports.restAPI }}

On your host machine, you can reach the elasticsearch API under

    http://localhost/{{ .Release.Namespace }}/elasticsearch
