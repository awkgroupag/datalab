    "1. Create a new **empty** repository (usually a private one, thus visible for Eraneos employees only) on the [AWK GitHub page](https://github.com/awkgroupag) (the green `New`-button). Note the new URL to your new repo, e.g. https://github.com/awkgroupag/MY-NEW-REPO\n",
    "2. Open a command prompt and navigate to your source code folder (`datalab` in the diagram above)\n",
    "  * :warning: Be sure to NOT have any data in the directory you are currently in! See above :warning:\n",
    "3. Type (replacing the URL)\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ git init\n",
    "# git's default branch name is master, let's change this to GitHub's main\n",
    "$ git branch -M main\n",
    "$ git remote add origin https://github.com/awkgroupag/MY-NEW-REPO\n",
    "# Add the entire datalab to your first commit\n",

    "4. You should be prompted for your GitHub credentials after the last command above\n",
    "5. Check [Atlassian's Comparing Workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) to get started with `git`. See the [Git-flow-Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) to understand collaboration with other team members.\n",
    "    * Use `git pull` to get the latest changes from GitHub\n",
    "    * Use `git commit` and `git push` to push your changes to GitHub\n",
    "    * Work with dedicated new branches for changes, do not work directly with the branch `main`!\n"
